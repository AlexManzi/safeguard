At Safegurd, we offer both attended monitoring and wireless monitoring depending on the client needs and ensures compliance with all city, state, and federal government standards. @ Safeguard has experience setting up seismographs in a variety of different locations.  Inside, outside, on walls, underground.  Whatever you're needs are, Safeguard will have a way to meet them. @ Attended monitoring is having a technician on-site to take live measurements of the vibration levels on-site.  Attended monitoring is most commonly performed for blasting jobs or for work adjacent to highly protected sites. @ Wireless monitoring offers monitoring 24/7, without the need for an on-site technician.  With a wireless setup, Safeguard offers the most affordable monitoring available.  Wireless monitoring offers live feedback as vibration levels approach regulations and sends our refined daily reports so we can always know you're levels.  Even without a power source. Safeguard has reliable solar power setups for any and all needs. @ Safeguard also offers vibration monitoring plans, stamped by a P.E. when needed, at an affordable rate. @ Safeguard is able to work with clients to determine the best setup for their project.

Licensed surveyors install settlement monitoring points (SMP's) or deformation monitoring points (DMP's) on a variety of structures including but not limited to buildings, bridges, culverts, dams, and tunnels. @ Safeguard is extremely precise and will detect any movement from the initial fixed point.  Typically, points are checked on a weekly basis, but Safeguard offers the flexibility to meet the needs of all clients.  After checking the points, easily understandable reports are generated and shared with the client."
